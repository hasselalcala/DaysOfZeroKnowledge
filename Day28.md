A Polynomial Commitment Scheme allows the prover to commits to a polynomial of degree at most "d" over this finite field

F =  F_{p}^{\leq d} [X] (univariate polynomial)

The prover commits to his polynomial and later on, the prover ca  n open the polynomial at any point "u"


A polynomial interactive oracle proof (Polynomial-IOP) is a way to prove that un fact the prover knows the witness such that:

prove E(volteada la E)w: C(x,w)=0

but the polynomial, first pre-processes the circuit C to generate prover and verifier parameters. However, verifier parameters are simply commitments to a s+1 number of polynomials.

Plonk is a Polynomial-IOP and if we add a PCS implies a SNARK. To construct a plonk, we need to keep in mind the following:

we are looking at a polynomial which has degree at most d and it is not the zero polynomial, if we sample a random from the finite field and we ask how likely is that f(r) is equal to zero.
