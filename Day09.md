# #DaysOfZeroKnowledge. Day 9.

Today, we are going to talk a particular type of ZKP, which does not require interaction between a verifier and a prover, is a Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge Proof (NIZK). 

NIZK are very suitable for Ethereum blockchain applications because they allow a smart contract to act as a verifier. This way, anyone can generate a proof and send it as part of a transaction to the smart contract, which can perform some action depending on whether the proof is valid or not. Also, this protocol can verify oneâ€™s statement to a larger group of people. 

The most preferable NIZK is Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) proof.
  
This protocol adds the following features:

- Succinct: The size of the proof is small enough to be verified in a few milliseconds.
- Non-interactive: the proof transcript consists of a single message - from the prover to the verifier.
- Argument: the proof would hold the soundness of zero-knowledge encryption and would be bound by polynomial-time. 
- Of knowledge: Prover and verifier cannot execute the process without a trusted witness. 

This protocol uses three functions:

-	Key generator: sets up a secret parameter to generate a key pair: a proving key and a verification key. 
- Prover function: takes the proving key, a common input, and a private input to generate a proof. 
- Verifier function: computes the verifier key, the common input and the proof generated by the prover function accept if the proof is correct and reject if it is not. 

When we want to use a non-interactive protocol, we need to use a trusted setup. The trusted setup is the process which generates part of the public data used by a prover when computing her proof.
