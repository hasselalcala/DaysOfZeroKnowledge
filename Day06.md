# #DaysOfZeroKnowledge. Day 6.

Today we are going to learn about a bit complex topic Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), to provide a simple overview of what ECC is and why it is considered secure.

The equation above is what is called Weierstrass normal form for elliptic curves. Depending on the value of $a$ and $b$, elliptic curves may assume different shapes on the plane. As it can be easily seen and verified, elliptic curves are symmetric about the x-axis.

We will also need a point at infinity (also known as ideal point) to be part of our curve and denote with the symbol 0 (zero).

In order for the set $G$ to be a group, an addition operation must satisfies Abelian Group Properties:
