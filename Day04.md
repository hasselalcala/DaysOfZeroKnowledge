# #DaysOfZeroKnowledge. Day 4.

Today, we aregoing to talk about RSA encryption. It is a mathematical problem that makes the internet work today. This algorithm relies on a concept of public and private keys and the idea of factoring large numbers using prime numbers. Public key is used to encrypt the message and private key is uses to decrypt the message. 

To obtain the keys, we need to follow the next steps:
