Day 1 of 30 #DaysOfZeroKnowledge. Today, I want to start this challenge with some background that will be useful to understand Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). 
ZKP is a protocol that enables one party, called the prover, to convince another, the verifier, that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the veracity of the statement. 

The main idea behind this concept is to prove possession of knowledge without revealing it. For example, Alice and Bob are racing to find Waldo.
