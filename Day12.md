# #DaysOfZeroKnowledge. Day 12.

Today we are going to continue talking about zk-SNARK. To apply zk-SNARK, a computation needs to be expressed in terms of algebraic circuit, converted to a constraint system called R1CS, and then finally a form called “quadratic arithmetic program” (QAP). Eran Tromer describe the steps of transformation for zk-SNARK. 



CANVA:::

The next days we are going to digs deeper into the machinery behind the technology, and tries to explain as well as possible the first half of the pipeline
