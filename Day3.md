Today we are going to learn about a bit complex topic Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), to provide a simple overview of what ECC is and why it is considered secure. 

What is an elliptic curve? Mathematically, an ECC is the set of point described by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ where $4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0$ (this is require to exclude singular curves). The equation above is what is called Weierstrass normal form for elliptic curves.
