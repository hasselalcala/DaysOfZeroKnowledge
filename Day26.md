# #DaysOfZeroKnowledge. Day 26.

Last friday we talk about Groth16 which is currently the gold standard of ZKPs. A benefit is that R1Cs is great - leads to high level domain specific languages (DSL) or advanced toolsets, such as: Zokrates, libsnark, circom, and aleo. That we can use today to write ZKP apps and smart contracts. However, since 2017, there's been an exxplosion in ZKP research to try to mitigate the trustes setup requirement while still competing with Groth16 on performance. 

The ZKP without a trusted setud use interactive oracle proofs, algebraic holographic proving systems, polynomial commitment scheme, and more. 

CANVA con ZKP without a trusted setup

As we see, there are a lot of ZKP without a trusted setup. Which ones should I pay attention to today?

CANVA STARK, 
CANVA PLONK
CANVA HALO2.
