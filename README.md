Since I finished my Ph.D. last November I started to study blockchain, bitcoin, and cryptocurrency because I was interested in smart contract programming. Smart contracts are simply programs written in high-level programming languages, such as solidity, and then compiled down to EVM bytecode and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.

In general, the idea behind blockchain involved the use of other techniques such as cryptography hash functions, digital signatures, or consensus algorithms, and for me, it was interesting to use these concepts in something new. However, on my road to learning about these new things and ideas, I discovered something amazing called "Zero - Knowledge Proof".

Letâ€™s remember that all the private data is public in the blockchain, if someone knows your address, they will be able to access all ledger entries. How much amount you are sending to whom. Which is not ideal. So what we need is a way to hide this data but also be able to verify that the data is not false. This is where zero-knowledge proofs come into the picture.
  
Something that keeps me motivated to code is to bring my ideas to life and solve a problem just using a computer, my hands and mind, I can show my creativity. Also, always there is still a lot to learn, or something that already exists uses for something new.

Technology is growing faster and If you do not keep learning, you will know soon know nothing.
