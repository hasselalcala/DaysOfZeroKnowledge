Since I finished my Ph.D. last November I start to study blockchain, bitcoin, and cryptocurrency because I am interested in smart contract programming with solidity. In general, the idea behind blockchain involved the use of other techniques such as cryptography hash functions, digital signatures, or consensus algorithms, so for me, it was interesting to use these concepts in something new.

Satoshi Nakamoto's idea with bitcoin was to allow electronic payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution and based on cryptographic proof instead of trust. Based on some bitcoin concepts, Vitalik Buterin develop Ethereum. Ethereum utilizes the distributed ledger model that originated with bitcoin and repurposes it to model a virtual computer, giving machine-level opcodes the same level of certainty as bitcoin transactions.

When I start to research and read more about Ethereum and blockchain, I feel interested in smart contracts. These are simply program written in high-level programming languages, such as solidity, and then compiled down to EVM bytecode and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.

I have been learning typescript programming, nodeJS, test-driven development, and solidity, with this I developed two projects to understand the operation of a blockchain and the difference between opcode and bytecode.

If you have some recommendations or want to give me feedback, contact me.
