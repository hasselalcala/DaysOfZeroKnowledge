# #DaysOfZeroKnowledge. Day 8.

Today we are going to define how elliptic curve works over a finite field. Letâ€™s remember that when we use modular math, we consider a set Zn, this is the finite field or the set of integers module p. 

The set of points that are described by the equation of a elliptic curve and the point at inifinity, now becomes a set of points where a and b are two integers that belong to Zn. Mathematically, is described as follows:

What previously was a continuous curve is now a set of disjoint points in the xy-plane. But even if we have restricted our domain, elliptic curves in 
an finite field still form an abelian group. For example:

Clearly, we need to change a bit our definition of addition in order to make it work in a finite field. With reals, we said that the sum of three aligned points was zero (P + Q + R = 0). We can keep this definition, but what does it mean for three points to be aligned in a finite field? Tomorrow we are going to talk about this. 

That's all for this thread. Thank you for reading! If you liked this thread, follow me @Hasseru and retweet.
