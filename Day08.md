# #DaysOfZeroKnowledge. Day 8.

Today we are going to define how elliptic curve works over a finite field. Letâ€™s remember that when we use modular math, we consider a set Zn, this is the finite field or the set of integers module p. 

The set of points that are described by the equation of a elliptic curve and the point at inifinity, now becomes a set of points where a and b are two integers that belong to Zn. Mathematically, is described as follows:

What previously was a continuous curve is now a set of disjoint points in the xy-plane. But even if we have restricted our domain, elliptic curves in 
an finite field still form an abelian group. For example:
