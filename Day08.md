Today we are going to define how elliptic curve works over a finite field. Letâ€™s remember that when we use modular math, we consider a set Zn, this is the finite field or the set of integers module p. 

The set of points that are described by the equation of a elliptic curve and the point ar inifinity, now becomes a set of points where a and b are two integers that belong to Zn. Mathematically, is described as follows:
