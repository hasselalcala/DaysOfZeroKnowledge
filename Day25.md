# #DaysOfZeroKnowledge. Day 25.

Today we are going to go diving into the zk-SNARKs Setup Phase. As we mention some days ago, anyone who deploys a zk-SNARK circuit to production must perform a computation called a trusted setup in order to generate a proving key and verifying key. Unfortunately, this process also produces a piece of data called toxic waste which must be discarded, as it can be used to produce fake proofs and thereby violate the security of the system. 

This requires that both the prover and verifier have access to some common knowledge, usually encoded in a Common Reference String (CRS) or Structured Reference String (SRS), a way of saying that the proving and verification keys are generated by the same setup algorithm, and are mostly the same. 

In our example, we use circom and snarkjs.

But, why is groth16 so great? Well, ZKP are typically grade on prover time, proof size and verification time. Groth16 present the following features:


To solve this, the trusted setup can be performed using a special cryptographic ceremony in which multiple participants each take turns to perform a computation.
