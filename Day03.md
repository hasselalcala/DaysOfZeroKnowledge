# #DaysOfZeroKnowledge. Day 3.

Today, we are going to study one of the first practical implementations of public-key cryptography, Diffie - Hellman Algorithm (DHA). This algorithm was published in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. It is a key - exchange protocol that enables two parties communicating over public channel to establish a mutual secret without it being transmitted over the Internet. Let's consider the following example:

Now Alice and Bob know to encrypt/decrypt their messages using the shared secret key 10.

DHA uses a private-public key pair to establish a shared secret, typically a symmetric key, is not a symmetric algorithm â€“ it is an asymmetric algorithm used to establish a shared secret for a symmetric key algorithm. As you notice, this algorithm is based on some modular math. 

That's all for this thread. Thank you for reading!
