# #DaysOfZeroKnowledge. Day 20.

In the following days, weâ€™ll cover the various techniques to write circuits, and show you how to create and verify proofs off-chain and on-chain on ethereum. Today we are going to learn the pre-requisites to create and execute our first ZK proof using circom and snarkjs libraries.

First off, make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed.
