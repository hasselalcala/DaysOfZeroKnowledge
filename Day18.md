# #DaysOfZeroKnowledge. Day 18.

Today we are going to learn the basis about circom language. In circom, actual circuits are called components.

A key feature of circom is that provdes different instructions to work only at the symbolic level, at the computational level or both. As follows:

It would be desirable to always use <=== operator, but sometimes we cannot. For example, if we want to design a circuit that checks if the input is zero, we need the following: 

![input is zero?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasselalcala/DaysOfZeroKnowledge/main/images/circom_05.png)

![input is zero?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasselalcala/DaysOfZeroKnowledge/main/images/circom_06.png)


That's all for this thread, tomorrow we will continue learning more about circom. Thank you for reading! If you liked, follow me @Hasseru and retweet.
