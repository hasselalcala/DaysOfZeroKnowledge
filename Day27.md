# #DaysOfZeroKnowledge. Day 27.

Today we are going to talk about ZKP without a trusted setup. As we mention, Groth16 is currently use and include some benefits, for example R1Cs is great - leads to high level domain specific languages (DSL) or advanced toolsets, such as: Zokrates, libsnark, circom, and aleo. That we can use today to write ZKP apps and smart contracts. However, the ZKP without a trusted setud use interactive oracle proofs, algebraic holographic proving systems, polynomial commitment scheme, and more. 

As we see, there are a lot of ZKP without a trusted setup. Which ones should I pay attention to today?

We are reaching the last days of this challenge, which will be 30 days. The following days I want to share the resources and tips that I have used to prepare this challenge.

That's all for this thread. Thank you for reading! If you liked, follow me @Hasseru and retweet.
