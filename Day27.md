# #DaysOfZeroKnowledge. Day 27.

Last friday we talk about Groth16 which is currently the gold standard of ZKPs. A benefit is that R1Cs is great - leads to high level domain specific languages (DSL) or advanced toolsets, such as: Zokrates, libsnark, circom, and aleo. That we can use today to write ZKP apps and smart contracts. 

The ZKP without a trusted setud use interactive oracle proofs, algebraic holographic proving systems, polynomial commitment scheme, and more. 

As we see, there are a lot of ZKP without a trusted setup. Which ones should I pay attention to today?
